## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 5, Part 2

This was a fun lab because we had to make the code succesfully translate the data value of feet in decimals to change into feet and inches together. It used a wide array of functions such as integers and doubles while also using static casts to swap the values around.

Lab 11, Part 1

This lab was interesting and the reason was that we can figure out what the most densest state is and what the most sparsest state is as well. It also gives the value right next to the state value for the densest and sparsest. I also think its cool that it grabs the value from a file that contains many values and it's cool how we were able to grab that information and sort through it to use what we want.

Lab 9, Part 1

I liked this one because it is a spellchecker program that scans a document file for any missplelled words that are spelled improperly. The way that it checks is also cool because it has another file that is the dictionary of all words and if there is a word in a file that doesnt pop up in the dictionary file it will tell you by printing out the spelling errors.
